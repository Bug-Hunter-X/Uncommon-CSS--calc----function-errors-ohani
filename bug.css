The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common error that arises when using the `calc()` function: 

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(100% - 10px); 
}
```

This code intends to set the width of the element to 100% of its container minus 10 pixels. However, if the `10px` is not followed by a space, several browsers will not correctly interpret this calculation, and the `width` may default to `100%`.

The space between the percentage and the subtracted value is crucial for proper interpretation.

Another instance of this can occur when nesting `calc()` functions without proper spacing or when using units inconsistently within the `calc()` function.

Another less common error is the usage of `calc()` in combination with properties that aren't numerically based or are not compatible with the operators used within `calc()`. For instance, you can't use `calc()` to compute values that include colors, strings, or properties like `auto` directly within the formula.
